                is arranged on the principle of a hot shop, i.e. when preparing dishes, exclusively fresh and high-quality products
                are used, dishes are prepared under the knife and served hot. The menu offers a wide variety of dishes prepared from
                chicken meat: burgers, twisters, longers, etc. The signature dish is a chicken in the author's breading. In addition to
                hot dishes, salads, snacks (snacks), drinks, desserts, as well as a special children's menu, taking into account the
                requirements for children's nutrition, are also presented.
